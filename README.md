# The Weather Report Python

This is a weather report written in python language. However, it does not rely on the astronomy observations. Instead, it use the data in the past to make decisions.Temperature and wind are considered in this program. You can choose to use Random Forest Classifier or MPL Classifier.

The number of the trees or the hidden layers are provided by us according to our experiments. You can change them if you would love to. Open file *main.py* (does not exist until version v0.3) to find the constant value TREE_NUM or HIDDEN_LAYER and change them.

Now the data are from <http://tianqihoubao.com/lishi/shanghai/month/201101.html>, which means that the data are only useful in Shanghai. We'll fix it in the following versions, add Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan and Tianjin.
